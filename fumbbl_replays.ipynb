    "# Analyzing Blood Bowl kick-off formations using FUMBBL replay data\n",
    "\n",
    "the botbowl ppl are discussing writing a parser for the json that would result in log with chess like notation ie P1 - B - E4 to C5 - (player one chooses blitz, moves from position e4 to c5 etc.\n",
    "Currently my knowledge is too limited to contribute to such an endeavour.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have however cooked up a new FUMBBL data analysis project using replays. \n",
    "To learn how to work with the replay files, I want to try and extract the set-up formations for a high stakes tournament (Road to Malta, or the Tilean Team Cup).  \n",
    "With the data I like to develop a nice viz, working with board positions together with the roster. \n",
    "When that goes somewhere I will scale it up to order 100, and try to make plots that either stack / aggregate formations, or do a cluster analysis on the start up formations, and see what can be learned from all of this ðŸ™‚ \n",
    "\n",
    "# What has already been done\n",
    "\n",
    "Christian Huber (aka Candlejack) seems our man here. He has two repo's open that are of great interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "First is https://github.com/SanityResort/htmlreplay\n",
    "\n",
    "This connect to the FFB server and requests a replay file that it reads in and converts to JSON.\n",
    "The goal seems to be to be able to visualize a replay in the browser via HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then there is https://github.com/SanityResort/FFBStats\n",
    "This is code that processes replay files and extracts information from them. Exactly what we want as well!\n",
    "It was written in 2016 and integrated into the site in 2017 by Christer. They went away and came back in 2022.\n",
    "It produces a match statistics file as JSON, that forms the basis of a nice visualization on the match result page on FUMBBL.\n",
    "The match statistics are available through the API.\n",

    "# FUMBBL Replay datafiles: opening up the black box\n",
    "\n",
    "Replay data is quite verbose and thereâ€™s lots of it. The FFB client communicates with the Server using Java Web Sockets.\n",
    "The raw data packages send over the line are web sockets. \n",
    "A replay file would be the json command stream. Itâ€™s a complex format, as itâ€™s more or less just logging the data packets between the client and server. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, after unzipping, opening as JSON in VScode and doing autoformatting, we end up with a 266K lines of client server \"command\" stream.\n",
    "Each turn is about 10K lines, with roster info at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "The high level file format is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\n",
