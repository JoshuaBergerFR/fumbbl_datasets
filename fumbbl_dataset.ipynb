    "# Construction of a public dataset of Blood Bowl matches played on FUMBBL.com\n",
    "\n",
    "This blogpost is about **Blood Bowl**, a boardgame I started playing last year. The goal of this blog post is to use Python API and HTML scraping to fetch online Blood Bowl match outcome data, and to create a structured dataset ready for analysis and visualization. This blogpost is written as a Jupyter notebook containing Python code, and is fully reproducible. The idea is to make Blood Bowl data analysis accessible to others. Using open source tooling reduces the barriers for others to build on other peopleâ€™s work.\n"

    "## Dataprep: transforming the team values\n",
    "\n",
    "In Blood Bowl, teams can develop themselves over the course of multiple matches. The winnings of each match can be spend on buying new, stronger players, or replace the players that ended up getting injured or even killed. In addition, players receive so-called *star points* for important events, such as scoring, or inflicting a casualty on the opponent. Therefore, a balancing mechanism is needed when a newly created \"rookie\" team is facing a highly developed opposing team with lots of extra skills and strong players. \n",
    "\n",
    "Blood Bowl solves this by calculating for both teams their **Current team value**.\n",
    "The **Team value difference** for a match determines the amount of gold that the weaker team can use to buy so-called **inducements**.\n",
    "These inducements are temporary, and can consists of a famous \"star player\" who joins the team just for this match. Another popular option is to hire a wizard that can be used to turn one of the opposing players into a frog.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is well known that the win rates of the teams depend on how developed a team is. For example, Amazons are thought to be strongest at low team value, as they already start out with lots of *block* and *dodge* skills, whereas a Chaos team start out with almost no skills.\n",
    "So if we compare win rates, we would like take into account the current team value. \n",
    "Now as this can differ between the two teams in a match up, I reasoned that the highest team value is most informative about the average strength level of both teams, because of the inducement mechanism described above. (In the next step, we will add information on inducements)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the dataset, we have for each match the current team values of both teams as a text string. \n",
    "We transform the text string `1100k` into an integer number `1100`, so that we can calculated the difference as `tv_diff`, and pick for each match the maximum team value and store it as `tv_match`. Finally, we create a team value bin `tv_bin` to be able to compare win rates for binned groups of matches where races have comparable team strength / team development.\n"

    "As most other available information through the team API can vary over time (i.e. number of games played, how may rerolls a team has, or whether it has an apothecary), we do no fetch this information (expect number of games played), as we cannot link it to specific matches.

    "Here we add both to the `df_mbt` dataframe, as in this dataset each row is about a single team, instead of a pairing.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to [this article from the NAF from 2017](https://www.thenaf.net/2017/05/tiers/), already since 2010 efforts were made to balance things out a bit between the different team strengths. For example, the weaker teams get more gold to spend on players, or get more so-called \"Star player points\" to spend on skilling players up. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to [the NAF](https://www.thenaf.net/tournaments/information/tiers-and-tiering/), traditionally team tiering consists of three groups, with Tier 1 being the strongest teams, and tier 3 the weakest teams. \n",

    "The GW BB2020 rule book also contains three tier groups, that are similar to the NAF tiers: except for Humans and Old World Alliance. \n",

    "\n",
    "Since our data comes from the **FUMBBL.com** website, we check the [**Privacy policy**](https://fumbbl.com/p/privacy) where all users, including myself have agreed on when signing up. It contains this part which is specific to the unauthenticated API, which we use to fetch the data, as well as additional public match data, such as which inducements are used in a match, and the Coach rankings of the playing coaches that were current when the match was played.\n",

This includes things such as forum posts, private message posts, blog entries, team and player names and biographies and news comments. Data provided this way is visible by other people on the website and in most cases public even to individuals without accounts (not including private messages), and as such are considered of public interest. If direct personal information is posted in public view, you can contact moderators to resolve this. Match records are also considered content in this context, and is also considered of public interest. This data is collected as the primary purpose of the website and it is of course entirely up to you how much of this is provided to FUMBBL. \n",

I decided to choose a CC0 license: this places the data in the public domain, and people can use the dataset as they wish. Citing or mentioning the source of the data would still be appreciated of course."
