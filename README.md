# fumbbl_datasets
This repository hosts the FUMBBL datasets scraped from https://www.fumbbl.com .
Scraping is semi-automated and is done at irregular intervals.

The folder `datasets` contains the current and previous release.

The Jupyter Notebook `fumbbl_dataset.ipynb` contains the current code that produces the current release of the datasets.

See https://gsverhoeven.github.io/post/blood-bowl-fumbbl-dataset/ for a data paper describing a previous version of these datasets (v0.1).
